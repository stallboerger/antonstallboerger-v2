The App Store is filled with apps that just serve the purpose. They do what they are supposed to do, but they don't do it in a way that makes you want to use them. To value the apps that are created with love and passion in every detail, I created a concept for a collection of great apps worth using.

        priority
    />
    <figcaption>Preview screens</figcaption>
