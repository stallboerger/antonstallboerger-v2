The UPS app is a popular mobile application that allows users to track and manage their packages, schedule pick-ups, and access other UPS services on the go. However, the app had been criticized for its outdated design and lack of user-friendly features. As a result, I decided to undertake a redesign of the app to improve its user experience and functionality.

## Challenges

The previous design was cluttered and difficult to navigate, which made it frustrating for users to find the information they needed. The app also lacked a cohesive design system, which made it difficult to create a consistent user experience across the app.

## Solution

I started by conducting user research to understand the needs and pain points of UPS customers. I used this information to create a new design that was clean and easy to navigate. I also created a new design system that was consistent across the app.

## Conclusion

Overall, the UPS app redesign was a successful project that demonstrates the value of investing in user-centered design and testing to create a better product.
